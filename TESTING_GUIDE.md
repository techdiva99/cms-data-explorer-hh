### If Charts Don't Load:
1. Check Plotly dependency: Should be installed
2. Try refreshing the page
3. Check browser console for errors

### If Performance is Slow:
1. Use smaller geographic areas first
2. Add quality filters to reduce result sets
3. Check system resources

## üöÄ Advanced Testing

### API-Style Testing (Python Console)
```python
# Test analytics directly
from analytics import CMSAnalytics
analytics = CMSAnalytics()

# Test provider search
providers = analytics.find_providers_by_location(state="CA", high_quality_only=True)
print(f"Found {len(providers)} high-quality CA providers")

# Test market analysis
market = analytics.get_market_analysis("Los Angeles", "CA")
print(f"LA market: {market['total_providers']} providers")

# Test quality benchmarks
benchmarks = analytics.get_quality_benchmarks()
print(f"National average: {benchmarks['mean_quality']:.2f}")

analytics.close()
```

### Database Direct Testing
```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

conn = sqlite3.connect('cms_homehealth.db')

# Test data integrity
providers = pd.read_sql("SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM providers", conn)
print(f"Total providers: {providers.iloc[0]['count']:,}")

# Test quality distribution
quality = pd.read_sql("""
    SELECT 
        CASE 
            WHEN composite_quality_score >= 4.5 THEN '5 Star'
            WHEN composite_quality_score >= 3.5 THEN '4 Star'
            WHEN composite_quality_score >= 2.5 THEN '3 Star'
            WHEN composite_quality_score >= 1.5 THEN '2 Star'
            ELSE '1 Star'
        END as rating,
        COUNT(*) as count
    FROM providers 
    WHERE composite_quality_score IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY rating
""", conn)
print(quality)

conn.close()
```
